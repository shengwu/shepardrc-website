	<h2>Woo-Shep Olympics</h2>
    <div id="olym">
    <img src="<?php echo $html_htdocs; ?>about/traditions/images/olym (1).jpg" id="pic1" />
    
<p>This annual competition faces Shepard off with our rival, Willard Residential College. Shep and the Woo-Shack battle in events like pie-eating, dodge ball, quiz bowl, and three-legged races, and the winner receives a trophy resembling the back half of a horse. The Woo-Shep Olympics is a classy affair. Shepard won in 2011 but lost in 2012, and we are eager to reclaim the crown.</p>

<h2>Midnight Ultimate &amp; Midnight Running Club</h2>
<p>Every Sunday, Sheep take a break from homework, meet in the lobby at midnight, and head over to Deering Field for a good game of Ultimate. The games continue through the winter, during rain or snow, as Shepard residents relieve stress with a frisbee. Under the leadership of Kate Bell, the fearless CA of the 3rd floor, Sheep come to the lobby at 12:00 midnight on Mondays and Wednesdays to prove just how hardcore Shepard really is. At the end of the night, the Shepard chant of "bloodkill" can be heard across campus from the lungs of the little running Sheep.</p>

<h2>Four nights of Halloween</h2>
<div id="halloween">
<img id="pic2" src="<?php echo $html_htdocs; ?>about/traditions/images/halloween (1).JPG" />
<p>Because one day just isn't enough to show everyone your creative costumes, Shepard extends Halloween into a four night extravaganza of decorations and trick-or-treating. Each of the four floors hosts trick-or-treating for one night, usually with a theme to inspire people to dress up.</p>
</div>
<h2>Coffeehouse</h2>
<div id="coffee">
<img id="pic1" src="<?php echo $html_htdocs; ?>about/traditions/images/coffee (4).jpg" />
<p>Every quarter, on the Sunday before finals week, Shepard alumni and residents cozy up in the piano lounge with some coffee and pastries and enjoy one last night of fun before exams eat everyone's souls. Entertainment is provided by your fellow Sheep, with performances of piano works, slam poetry, singing, and belly dancing. This happens right after we head outside at precisely 9 pm to join in the campus wide primal scream. </p>
</div>
<h2>Bathroom minutes</h2>
<div id="minutes">
<img id="pic3" src="<?php echo $html_htdocs; ?>about/traditions/images/minutes (1).png" />
<p>Penned by the secretary, the bathroom minutes are posted in each stall to give you something to read when you really have nothing else to do. They keep you informed about campus and Shepard events, as well as enlighten you with whatever random trivia the secretary feels like tossing in.</p>
</div>
<h2>Spring Formal</h2>
<img id="pic1" src="<?php echo $html_htdocs; ?>about/traditions/images/formal (1).jpg" />
<p>Every spring, the Sheep put on their fancy clothes, get dolled up, and   hit the Formal, normally at a hotel in the area. In spring 2012, the   formal was held at the swanky Hotel Orrington. It was Mad Men themed,   complete with a non-alcoholic cocktail bar, candy cigarettes, and a   photo booth.  Because the formal is in the spring, it allows everyone   who has bonded throughout the year to have lots of fun.</p>

<h5>Newer traditions</h5>
<p>The following three traditions still have a few years to go before they mature into the real traditions at left.</p>
<h5>Mr. Shepard (since 2011)</h5>
<p>Mr. Shepard is a men's pageant held to raise money for whatever dorm-wide philanthropy is going on at the time. The finest men in Shepard compete in a swimsuit, a talent, and an interview round for the glory of being crowned and for a prize (this year it was a gift card to Chipotle). Winners are determined by donations from the audience. Have your cameras ready for some blackmail-worthy footage.</p>
<h5>ShepTalks (since 2012)</h5>
<p>ShepTalks is an academic event where students or professors give short talks about research they're involved in, new ideas they're passionate about, or cool skills that they have. Expect student talks in the fall &amp; spring and faculty talks in the winter!</p>
<h5>Intellectu-wool (since 2012)</h5>
<p>This is Shepard's own literary magazine showcasing the sheep's boundless creativity. Submissions can include anything from prose and poetry to photography, cartoons, jokes, and art. </p>
