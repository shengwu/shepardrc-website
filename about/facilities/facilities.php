		<h1>Facilities</h1>

<h2>Piano Lounge</h2>

</div>
<p>When you walk into the main entrance of Shepard, you may hear some beautiful melodies coming from your left. No, you're not hallucinating. You're probably hearing one of Shepard's finest making beautiful music on the baby grand located in the aptly named Piano Lounge. A generally large and pretty room, the piano lounge is also home to firesides, meetings for many student groups, and the quarterly Coffeehouse, where our talented residents show off for the rest of us.</p>

<h2>Classroom</h2>
<div class="mouseoverwrap">

<img src="<?php echo $html_htdocs; ?>images/about/classroom2.jpg" width="698"  />
</div>
<p>If you're a Northwestern student, there's no way around it: academics are pretty important. And Shepard has you covered, having its very own classroom. The whiteboards seem to be perpetually covered with meeting plans or math problems, as people use the classroom for club meetings, study sessions, and actual Shepard-only classes (for academic credit, covering topics like Bioethics) each quarter. That's right. If you live in Shepard, you could wake up a minute before class, walk downstairs and show up in bunny slippers.</p>

<h2>TV Lounge</h2>
<div class="mouseoverwrap">
<img class="mouseover" src="<?php echo $html_htdocs; ?>images/about/tvlounge.jpg" width="698"  />
<img src="<?php echo $html_htdocs; ?>images/about/tvlounge2.jpg" width="698"  />
</div>
<p>Football games, basketball championships, and the weekly episode of Grey's Anatomy. The TV lounge is good for a lot of things, since it sports a huge widescreen television and tons of couches. However, you can have fun in the TV lounge without staring at a screen; there are ping-pong, pool, and foosball tables for your enjoyment. Munchies are held here every week, as well as occasional firesides, performances, and group meetings.</p>

<h2>Study Lounge</h2>
<div class="mouseoverwrap">
<img class="mouseover" src="<?php echo $html_htdocs; ?>images/about/study.jpg" width="698"  />
<img src="<?php echo $html_htdocs; ?>images/about/study2.jpg" width="698"  />
</div>
<p>Have a loud roommate or want free wireless? Go no further than the Shep basement and sit down at one of the desks in the Study Lounge. This room is known to be really quiet at all times, so still that the automatic motion sensor doesn't pick anything up for a while, and the lights subsequently turn off after a while. After a few seconds, someone stands up, waves his arms, and the lights turn back on. That's how hardcore the study lounge is. But nothing's better than a silent space without any distractions when you have two finals the next morning. And that's what the Study Lounge can offer.</p>

<h2>Practice Rooms</h2>
<div class="mouseoverwrap">
<img class="mouseover" src="<?php echo $html_htdocs; ?>images/about/practice.jpg" width="698"  />
<img src="<?php echo $html_htdocs; ?>images/about/practice2.jpg" width="698"  />
</div>
<p>If you're a music major, a theatre major, a dance major, or just enjoy performing and need somewhere to practice, there is no better place to live than Shepard. Why? Because you don't need to wake up your entire floor if you're inclined to play tuba at four in the morning. You can just go down to the basement and make use of one of our practice rooms. Each practice room has a piano, and one has a ballet barre and a mirror for Sheep of the dancing persuasion.</p>

<h2>Kitchen</h2>
<div class="mouseoverwrap">
<img class="mouseover" src="<?php echo $html_htdocs; ?>images/about/kitchen.jpg" width="698"  />
<img src="<?php echo $html_htdocs; ?>images/about/kitchen2.jpg" width="698"  />
</div>
<p>Like to cook? Want to raise money for Dance Marathon by selling cookies or brownies? Bake food for the rest of us in the Shepard Kitchen. We certainly have the amenities for you. We have an industrial size refrigerator and freezer, two microwaves, an oven, a stove, and a huge sink. We also have a pantry where there are bowls and utensils for shared use.</p>

<h2>Laundry Room</h2>
<div class="mouseoverwrap">
<img src="<?php echo $html_htdocs; ?>images/about/laundry.jpg" width="698"  />
</div>
<p>This is where you clean your clothes &mdash; that's pretty much it. A wash costs $1, as does a dryer cycle. You can use quarters or use Munch Money on your Wildcard. All of the washers and driers are new, either installed this year or last year. What's cool about the laundry room is that it's located in the basement, right next to the kitchen and the practice rooms. So while you're folding your T-shirts, you can listen to someone playing the saxophone and smell the yummy stuff the social chairs are cooking up for munchies later.</p>

<h2>Exec Office</h2>
<p>This is the second home for the Shepard President and Vice President. It features lots of stuff the Exec Board needs, and also has a gigantic test file. If you turn in old tests, you get housing points, and your friends who have the same class later can borrow said tests to help them study. It's a pretty good deal. The Exec Office also sports a pretty cool mural on one wall.</p>

<h2>Screening Lounge</h2>
<div class="mouseoverwrap">
<img class="mouseover" src="<?php echo $html_htdocs; ?>images/about/screen1.JPG" width="698"  />
<img src="<?php echo $html_htdocs; ?>images/about/screen1.JPG" width="698"  />
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Located just across from the TV lounge, the screening lounge is an excellent place to take a break and relax.  Our surround sound system combined with a huge projector screen will make any movie an awesome experience.  You can also hook up your game system, PC, or Mac computer to do anything you'd like.  Many people actually use the solidarity of the room to hold study groups or even practice an instrument.  Either way, this new addition to our building will likely make your living experience here just THAT much better.</p>

<h2>Master's Office</h2>
<p>This is the place where the Master of Shepard, engineering professor Randy Freeman, gets his Shepard work done. If you see him in there, stop by and say hello! Professor Freeman also frequently joins us for lunch in the Shepard Dining Room located in Allison Hall. He's a pretty cool guy.</p>

<h5>Who can use these rooms?</h5>
<p>You, if you live here! Unless they've been reserved, these rooms are for the use of Shepard residents.</p>

<h5>How do I reserve a room?</h5>
<p>For most rooms, you will have to see the Vice President for approval: making a sign with the details of your reservation, getting him or her to sign it, and then posting it at the entrance of the room you're reserving. For detailed information, see our <a target="_blank" href="<?php echo $html_htdocs;?>government/policies/RoomReservation.pdf">room reservation policies</a>.</p>
