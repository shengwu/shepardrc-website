<h1>Activities</h1>

<h2>Munchies</h2>
<p>Two words: Free food. Can it get any better? Every Thursday night, Shepard's Social Chairs lay out an array of food, either from area restaurants or straight from the Shepard kitchen, ranging from Krispy Kreme donuts to kindergarten-themed lunch bags to a Mardi Gras party with gumbo and king cake. Sheep tend to arrange their schedules around munchies, which allow them to take a break from studying to stuff their faces and chat with friends.</p>


<h2>Firesides</h2>
<p>One of the benefits to living in a residential college is the many different firesides given throughout the year. A fireside usually consists of a Northwestern faculty member discussing interesting topics with a small group of Sheep. However, firesides can also be hosted by student groups, who perform or speak for the group. Some of this year's firesides covered Greek life, salsa dance, and musical hypnotherapy. Because Shepard is a multithematic residential college, firesides run a gamut of topics, leaving Sheep free to learn what interests them.</p>

<h2>Cross-RC trips</h2>
<p>Cross-RC trips are organized by the residential college board to send students in residential colleges to events on campus, in Evanston, and in Chicago at a discounted rate. This events range from sports games to museum visits, tours, and theatre productions. XRCs are open to students in all residential colleges.</p>

<h2>Faculty dinners</h2>
<p>Basically, a faculty dinner is a chance for you to eat out with a few other student and a faculty fellow. Shepard fellows accompany several Shepard residents to their favorite local restaurant and everyone enjoys free food supplemented with a more or less intellectual conversation. </p>

<h2>Philanthropy</h2>
<p>Philanthropy is an important part of all things Northwestern, Shepard included. Shep's Philanthropy Chair consistently sends out notices over our listserv updating Sheep about volunteer projects. Also, Sheep have an advantage for doing good: Not only can they serve the community, but also they can get housing points for philanthropy. One activity close to Shepard's heart is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nudm.org/">Dance Marathon</a>, where over 1000 Northwestern students raise money throughout the year for charity, then dance for 30 hours straight at the end. In 2012, NU raised over $1,100,000 to support cancer research and the Evanston Community Foundation. Shep has two Dance Marathon chairs, who regulate fundraising and provide care packages for dancing Sheep. Even non-dancing Sheep participate; this year a huge group of students decorated the dorm to congratulate the dancers, and then greeted them on the steps of Norris to carry dancers' bags.</p>

<h5>Who can go to activities?</h5>
<p>You! Although most activites you just show up to, some activities like XRC trips require you to sign up because they have limited space. Keep your eye on your inbox to learn about these opportunities.</p>

<h5>How do I keep track of activities?</h5>
<p>See our <a href="events">Events</a> page.</p>
<p>To keep track of other on-campus activites, just look around! Residents will post fliers the doors and in the hallways for things in which they're involved. We also have a Campus Events chair that sends out a weekly digest of campus events.</p>

<h5>Do activites cost money?</h5>
<p>Usually, no. At Shepard and all other residential colleges, you pay an activities fee as part of your Northwestern tuition that pays for social events, munchies, firesides, and other events that Shepard holds.</p>
