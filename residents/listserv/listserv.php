<h2>Sending emails</h2>
<p>To send a message to the Shepard listserv, address your email to shepard@listserv.it.northwestern.edu.</p>

<h2>Shepard Listserv Policy</h2>
<p>The Shepard listserv is moderated. All messages sent to the listserv first go to the tech chair for approval before they are sent to Shepard. The following guidelines are used when evaluating messages.</p>
<ol>
<li>Remember that faculty and administrators subscribe to the listserv.</li>
<li>Emails containing racist, sexist, offensive language, or otherwise abusive or derogatory comments will be refused (as indicated in university policy).</li>
<li>Emails announcing lost or found items that were lost or found in or near Shepard are accepted, as long as the estimated value of the lost item is above $10.00. For items that are valued less than $10.00 (lost socks, etc), residents should post announcements on the bulletin board in the basement near the vending machines and study lounge. The $10.00 rule does not apply to cash, to anything related to a class such as notes or a textbook, or to ID. Please avoid sending multiple emails regarding the same item.</li>
<li>If you are selling, such as a textbook, please send your email to the listserv with the subject line "SALE." These emails will be compiled by the tech chair and sent out in one email at the end of each day. You must provide your return email address in your email so buyers can reply.</li>
<li>The same applies for requests to share a cab at the end of the quarter. The subject line should say "CAB."</li>
<li><i>Third party campaigning is prohibited.</i> This means that a Shepard listserv member may send an email to the Shepard listserv if she/he is running for election to ASG or another position outside Shepard. However, a listserv member may not endorse or otherwise campaign for a candidate, unless that candidate is a member of the listserv. Campaigning for election to Shepard Exec or SCC is not allowed over the listserv.</li>
<li>Public viewings of movies cannot be advertised over the listserv because they are considered copyright infringement.</li>
<li>Pranks cannot be advertised over the listserv.</li>
<li>Surveys sent over the listserv for an undergraduate university class or for a student group are allowed. Graduate student research (any research with human subjects) needs to be approved by the Institutional Review Board, IRB in order to be advertised over the listserv.</li>
<li>Chain emails and junk emails are prohibited.</li>
</ol>

<h5>What is the Shepard listserv?</h5>
<p>The Shepard listserv is an email system provided by the university that allows Shepard residents and non-res's to send messages to everyone subscribed to the listservs. The listservs are used by sheep to announce elections, munchies, firesides, trips, campus activities, and more.</p>
<p>Anyone can send emails to the regular Shepard listserv. The ShepardExec listserv should only be used for Exec board members to send out information about official Shepard/RCB events to the rest of the Sheep.</p>

<h5>I get too many emails from the listserv!</h5>
<p>Email the <a target="_blank" href="mailto:tech@shepardrc.com">Tech Chair</a> if you find one person keeps spamming the listserv. Otherwise, Gmail has tools to manage your email: learn about <a target="_blank" href="http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=6579">filters</a>.</p>
