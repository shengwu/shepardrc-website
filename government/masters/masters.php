<p>I am a Professor in  the Psychology Department and the School of Education.  This will be my second term as Master of  Shepard, having previously served from 2003 until 2007.  I am very happy to be returning to Shepard.</p>
  <p> Shepard is a wonderful  place to live and work.  Two things stand  out:  First, we are very diverse group,  in every sense of the word.  Students  come from almost every College or School in the University, and you&rsquo;ll find  dozens of majors represented.  Second,  despite (or because of) our diversity, Shepard is a close community.  Students are genuinely interested in others,  devote a great deal of time philanthropy, and participate in many events  together. </p>
  <p>The focus on working  across fields is probably what attracted me to Shepard in the first place.  My research and teaching are very  interdisciplinary, focusing on how people learn from visual displays, such as  maps, graphs, and charts.  I study people  from age 18 months to well past college.   You can read more about my work at <a href="http://groups.psych.northwestern.edu/uttal/">http://groups.psych.northwestern.edu/uttal/</a> </p>
  <p> My job as Master is  primarily to help you meet faculty.  We  have an active and enthusiastic group of Faculty Fellows who come from many  different disciplines.  You&rsquo;ll have lots  of chances to meet them—at lunch in our dining room, at a dinner at a local  restaurant, or on one of the many trips we have planned to Chicago and other  locations.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to meeting you on move-in  day.</p>

<p>I grew up in the wine  country of Northern California, where we complain about extreme cold when  temperatures are in the 40s and the summers are so mild and humidity-free that  no one owns an air conditioner. And thus until the age of 17 I pretty much  thought that&rsquo;s just what weather was like. When I moved to Portland, Oregon to  attend Reed College, I learned about rain, amongst lots of other things. Reed  is a strange and delightful place with extremely high academic standards and a  righteous bunch of weirdos for students and faculty, and it was there that I  realized my life&rsquo;s ambition was to become an absent-minded professor. I majored  in Literature-Theatre, did a stint at an acting school in London, drank a lot  of black tea, became completely nocturnal for a while and wrote a thesis on  Renaissance anatomy theatres and really violent Jacobean plays.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>In 2008, I moved to Chicago  to become a graduate student. I have since discovered snow, wind, and humidity.  Hoo boy.&nbsp;I love working as a Ph.D. student in Northwestern&rsquo;s  Interdisciplinary Theatre &amp; Drama program. I&rsquo;m studying the ways scientists  use performance to teach people about their work, and my dissertation is on  performances about the human brain (like this one:<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight.html" target="_blank"> http://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight.html</a>)  and how they shape non-scientists' conceptions of what brains do. I also LOVE  teaching theatre, and would be psyched to have you in one of my classes!  There&rsquo;s lots of experimentation and jumping around in my classrooms, which are  also things I&rsquo;m excited to do with my Sheep this year. I predict fun all round. </p>
  <p>Looking forward to  meeting you.  Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to  email me with questions, concerns, or random hellos! I'm excited to meet you!</p>

<h5>What do masters do?</h5>
<p>The Master is a senior faculty member who "guides the intellectual and programmatic life of each residential college." For example, he coordinates fellows' participation in an undergraduate research grant called the <a target="_blank" href="http://undergradresearch.northwestern.edu/research-opportunities/residential-college-fellow-assistant-researcher-award-fara">FARA</a>. Learn more about the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.northwestern.edu/residentialcolleges/masterstaff/index.html">Master staff</a>.</p>

<p>The Associate Master shares the responsibilities with the Master.</p>

<p>The Assistant Master is a graduate student who helps with administrative duties, like organizing cross-RC events. They are usually awesome.</p>
