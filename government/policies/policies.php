<h1>Shepard Policies</h1>
	
	<h2>Points</h2>
	<p>Points are necessary for staying in Shepard after your freshman year. If you were unfortunate enough to get placed in another dormitory, or perhaps even another residential college, the only way to become one of the sheep is to become a non-resident and to earn points. Points can be earned through participating in firesides and other academic events.</p>

<p>20 points are necessary by the end of winter quarter for those wishing to stay in Shepard. During the housing draft, those with the most points will get first pick of rooms, so if you're looking to get that nice dingle next year, try to amass as many points as you can!</p>
	
	<h2>Running for Exec or SCC</h2>
	<p>If you want to run for a position on exec, elections take place during the last half of Winter Quarter. All exec board positions are for three-quarter terms, with the exception of Secretary, who is elected every quarter and serves on both Exec and SCC.</p>
	
	<p>If you want to run for SCC, elections take place at the beginning of each quarter. These positions include Floor Reps, Capital Improvements Chair, Munchies Chair, Sergeant at Arms, and Campus Events Chair. Appointments vary in length. The positions of Intramural Chair and Historian are for three quarters. For more information, see the constitution below.</p>
