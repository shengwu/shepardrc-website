<p>Elizabeth Lewis Pardoe is a Northwestern faculty brat, who began her own relationship with NU as a debate Cherub in 1986. She graduated from NU with a major in History in 1992 then spent three years at Cambridge University in England as a Marshall Scholar where she earned an MLitt in 1994 for her thesis on Reformation Germany and an MPhil in Political Thought and Intellectual History in 1995. She returned to the US with her very English husband, Jack,  and completed her doctorate early American history at Princeton University in 2000 shortly after her elder son Freddy's first birthday. Freddy gained experience in lecture halls and in corporate teleconferences from 2000-2002 while his mommy was an Assistant Professor at Valparaiso University and his daddy telecommuted to Princeton. In June 2002 Robby arrived, and in early 2003, Beth signed her letter of resignation. Fate intervened to move the family to Evanston shortly thereafter, where Beth abused her father's library card to continue her scholarship and wrote for the History Channel's website until the Office of Fellowships saw fit to hire her in 2006. She also teaches History and American Studies.</p>
<p> Her  academic work scrutinizes responses to religious and ethnic conflict in   early modern Europe and colonial North America. &ldquo;Poor Children and   Enlightened Citizens:   Lutheran Education in America&rdquo; received the Pennsylvania Historical   Association&rsquo;s Robert G. Crist Prize in 2003.

	<div class="aspacer"></div>
</div>
<p>Jesse Rosenberg teaches music history and musicology with an emphasis on the 19th century. He has consistently drawn accolades from the School of Music's discriminating performance-based students, who regard Rosenberg's instruction as some of the best teaching they encounter at Northwestern. One student wrote, "Rosenberg makes class worth every minute of your time. Through multiple assigned readings and notoriously thick course packets and dynamic classroom discussion, he steeps his students in the subject matter, inspiring rigorous thinking and emboldening students to become more intellectual in their approach to music. Students also hold Rosenberg's use of the course management system in the highest regard &mdash; "presentations of electronic audio, video and textual resources vastly extend his students' own preparations and, by extension, classroom participation." Rosenberg has published numerous scholarly articles on19th-century Italian music and musical culture, including studies of Verdi, Donizetti, Bellini, Rossini, and the Florentine critic and aesthetician Abramo Basevi. His current research projects include an early unpublished opera by Ponchielli (the autograph manuscript of which is in the Music Library at Northwestern) and a study of Jewish characters in 19th-century operas by Rossini, Verdi, Halevy, Mascagni and Strauss.</p>

<p>Erin is a physical anthropologist with a subspecialty in forensics (feel free to tell her how much you love the show 'Bones', if you must).

Fun facts: Erin is a pathetic Wii Guitar Hero player who has not "given up", per se, but is merely taking a brief hiatus from the sport.

	<p>Associate Professor, Social Psychology<br />
	wgardner@northwestern.edu </p>
	<div class="aspacer"></div>
</div>
<p>Professor Gardner: my primary research interests concern the centrality of social inclusion to the self. In one line of work in the lab, we are particularly interested in the ways in which belonging needs are regulated through mental processes and behaviors likely to result in increased social inclusion (e.g., increased attention to others and enhanced sensitivity to emotional facial expressions and vocal tones) as well as by cognitive strategies designed to make the individual feel socially connected, regardless of their actual level of inclusion (e.g., inflating the closeness of one's interpersonal attachments, or looking at one's past group interactions through rose colored glasses). In another line, we examine the ways in which indiviudals define the self socially (e.g., through defining the self in terms of relationships and groups) as a function of culture, gender, social needs, and situational cues. Whether the self is defined in an individual or independent fashion or alternatively in a social or interdependent fashion, determines the types of strategies and standards used for self-regulation. Our lab studies flexibility across these different views of the self, and the functionality of each type of self-construal in different situations.</p>

<h5>Who are fellows?</h5>
<p>Fellows are Northwestern professors and lecturers associated with Shepard. They come to meals, host firesides, and talk to students who live here (which is why they became fellows &mdash; to get to hang out with students!) This kind of extracurricular faculty-student interaction is a benefit unique to the residential colleges.</p>

<h5>How can I interact with fellows?</h5>
<p>Attending firesides and eating lunch in the Shepard room in Allison are the easiest ways to find fellows.</p>
<p>However, there are many other ways you can meet and talk to fellows. These include cross-RC trips, facul-TEAs, and occasional academic trips that fellows lead.</p>
<p>Please don't be afraid to talk to fellows! Approach them as you would approach other students. (They're just a bit older and happen to be experts at something.)</p>
