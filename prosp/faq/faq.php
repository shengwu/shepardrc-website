<a name="1"></a><dt>How are rooms and roommates assigned or chosen?</dt>
<dd>
<p>For new residents, rooms are assigned randomly but roommate assignments based partly on the housing questionnaire you filled out or will fill out for student housing. Rooms are assigned randomly. For returning residents, everyone chooses roommates and each roommate pair chooses their room according to housing points from highest to lowest. For more information on housing points for returning students, see Housing Points.</p>
</dd>

<a name="2"></a><dt>How are the bathrooms?</dt>
<dd>
<p>According to Amy Yang, previous Tech Chair:</p>

<p>I honestly thought the bathrooms were fine, and (other than the occassional person who forgot to flush, or left their stuff on the towel hooks) don't remember hearing complaints from others. There are shower hooks for hanging stuff while you're in the showers. The shower stalls are a bit small but *shrug* you deal. Other than (if I remember correctly) once when there was a heater problem, there was always enough hot water.</p>

<p>Two camps seemed to develop during the year on leaving bathroom stuff (toothpaste, brushes, soap, etc) in the bathroom. Some people thought stuff should always be taken back to your room - when you're done showering, your stuff should go back with you. Others left their stuff on the ledges in the bathroom all the time. It's really up to you, who you share the bathroom with, and how comfortable you feel leaving your stuff out.</p>
</dd>

<a name="3"></a><dt>What's the deal with mail?</dt>
<dd>
Your mailing address is:
<pre>
YOUR NAME 
Shepard Residential College, Room ### 
626 University Pl 
Evanston, IL 60201
</pre>
<p>All incoming mail for Shepard is processed in to the Allison mail room. The Shepard mailboxes are the silver ones in the Allison Hall lobby, with box numbers corresponding to room numbers. Packages too large to fit in the box will be held in the mail room and you will receive an email alert when your package is ready to be picked up. Go to the mail room with your Wildcard to pick it up.</p>
</dd>

<a name="4"></a><dt>Where do I eat?</dt>
<dd><p>As a freshman or sophomore, you will mostly be eating in dining halls. The closest dining hall is literally only a hundred feet away in Allison. Unfortunately, Allison is only open on weekdays, so during the weekends you have to a little further to Foster-Walker Complex or to 1835 Hinman. When you get tired of dining hall food (and you will, trust me), Shepard is one of the dorms closest to downtown Evanston and all of the restaurants there. Some student favorites include Giordano's, Joyee's, and the 24-hour Burger King.</p></dd>

<a name="5"></a><dt>Where are my classes?</dt>
<dd><p>Where your classes are depends a lot on your major. Sorry to all you scientists and engineers, you'll be taking the trek to Tech nearly every day. Journalism and RTVF classes are usually scattered around south campus. Music classes and ensemble rehearsals are also all south. Many of the buildings, while they are associated with a certain department, will host classes outside of that department. As a general rule of thumb, technical classes are up north while liberal and performing arts are down south.
</p></dd>

<a name="6"></a><dt>Should I bring a TV?</dt>
<dd><p>This is completely up to you. Shepard has a flat screen TV with cable in the TV lounge that is free for you to watch sports, shows, movies, and play video games on. On the weekends there is usually a compromise on what movies get watched. Most people just use their laptops if they really want to see something and the TV is taken. If you are a gamer or are vehemently opposed to watching things on your laptop, you might think about bringing your own TV. Otherwise I wouldn't bother.</p></dd>

<a name="7"></a><dt>Will my stuff fit in my room?</dt>
<dd><p>Everything in your room at home is probably not going to fit in your dorm room, but there is more than enough space for everything that you need plus all that random stuff that accumulates throughout the year. Our fashionista president had some issues fitting all of her clothes into her armoire, but they're big enough for the average college wardrobe. Organization is really more important than the actual amount of stuff &mdash; consider bringing extra plastic drawers. Your room arrangement also impacts how much stuff you can fit. Just because it's situated with a bed on each side when you move in doesn't mean it has to stay that way.</p></dd>

<a name="8"></a><dt>How do I get around campus and Evanston?</dt>
<dd><p>To get around campus, most students walk or ride a bike. Northwestern's campus isn't huge; it takes about 20 minutes on foot to get from one end to the other. Gaps between classes are 10 minutes, so when you're choosing classes, avoid consecutive lectures that are on opposite ends of the campus (or bring a bike). If you're lucky you can sometimes catch a shuttle that will take you to Tech or back. Shuttles also run to Ryan field and extra shuttles are added to the route to take students to football and basketball games. </p>
<p>Getting around Evanston is usually done on foot or with a bike. You can also take the El if you need to go farther away. At night, Northwestern has shuttles that run throughout Evanston.</p>
</dd>

<a name="9"></a><dt>What are the best ways to get to and around Chicago?</dt>
<dd>
<p>To get into Chicago, the cheapest way is via the El or the Metra. The El, which stands for "elevated train", takes about an hour and fifteen minutes to get into downtown Chicago and costs $2.25 each way. Find maps of the El <a target="_blank" href="http://www.transitchicago.com/maps/">here</a>. To get downtown, take the Purple Line from the Davis to Howard and transfer to the Red Line to go to the loop. 
During weekday rush hours, the Purple Line Express offers a forty-five minute route from Evanston to downtown.</p>

<p>The Metra is a faster but more expensive train system &mdash; it costs $4.25 one way but gets you from Davis to Ogilvie Transportation Center downtown in 25 minutes. The Pace bus system is also useful for getting around Evanston and surrounding areas, beyond the range of walking distance.</p>

<p>On weekdays, Northwestern also offers a free Intercampus Shuttle service that runs between Northwestern's Evanston and Chicago campuses. There is also a Chicago Express shuttle service on Saturdays. Learn more about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.northwestern.edu/uservices/transportation/shuttles/">Northwestern Shuttles</a>.</p>

<p>Taxis are an alternative option that cost significantly more but may be worth it if you're under time constraints or have large amounts of luggage.</p>
</dd>

<a name="10"></a><dt>How do I get to and from the airport?</dt>
<dd>
<p>The cheapest way to O'Hare is Pace Route 250. It costs $1.75, goes from the Davis CTA station to O'Hare, and takes about 70 minutes.</p>

<p>There's a Northwestern-related business called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nuairhop.com/">AirHop</a> that can get you there more conveniently &mdash; it costs $15 one way to O'Hare and $25 one way to Midway</p>

<p>Also, several surburban cab companies will offer flat rates, usually around $41 to Midway and $25 to O'Hare; call the companies beforehand to make reservations. You can send an email to the Shepard Listserv about cab sharing.</p>
</dd>

<a name="11"></a><dt>Where do I buy things?</dt>
<dd><p>For everyday necessities, most students go to CVS (just down the street from Shepard). Every weekend there is also a shuttle that goes to Target. There are convenience stores in several dining halls, including Foster-Walker Complex and 1835 Hinman, as well as in Norris. If you're looking for food that's not available in a convenience store, Shepard is within walking distance to Whole Foods.</p>
<p>To buy books, you have several options. The campus bookstore in Norris has all the books you need conveniently organized by course, but is often the most expensive unless you get your books early enough to rent or to buy used. Beck's Bookstore is just as conveniently organized and is usually a little cheaper. It's also right across the street from Shepard. The cheapest place to buy books is Amazon, and if you sign up for an Amazon student account, you get several months of free 2 day shipping. At the beginning of each quarter there is also a wave of Shepard residents spamming the listserv with offers to sell their old books. If you can find an upperclassman who took the same course as you, their price is usually pretty cheap.</p>
</dd>

<a name="12"></a><dt>What should I bring?</dt>
<dd>
<p>There is probably an entire website devoted to what you should bring to college. I will not rehash the contents of said website here, but there are some things you might not have thought about:</p>
<ul>
<li>extra organization, like plastic drawers, shoe storage, and drawer dividers</li>
<li>extra clothes hangers</li>
<li>beach towel and blankets: even if you're not a beach person, studying is a lot more enjoyable when you do it laying out on the lakefill, Deering field, or Shepard's own courtyard</li>
<li>rain boots: they will be your best friend in the spring and winter</li>
<li>a printer: there are printers in the library, but you have to pay to use them, and while there are places that offer free printing, it's much more convenient to have one in your room</li>
<li>laundry detergent and dryer sheets (you should also figure out how to do your own laundry, if you don't know already)</li>
<li>a desk light, since the overhead lights sometimes don't quite cut it or if your roommate is sleeping while you're doing work</li>
<li>an eye-mask and earplugs, if you're a very light sleeper</li>
<li>simple, over-the-counter medications, like painkillers, antibiotic cream, and anti-itch cream, as well as band-aids</li>
<li>something that will help relieve stress: never underestimate how much good a simple de-stressing routine can do when midterms and essays are starting to pile up; this might not even be an object that you bring so much as an activity you can turn to for some zen</li>
</ul></p></dd>

<a name="13"></a><dt>How do I apply to Shepard?</dt>
<dd><p>The first step is to list Shepard as one of your top housing choices. At the end of your housing application, there will be a section of short-answer questions that you must answer if you are applying to any residential college, including Shepard. Don't be intimidated by the questions; this is not a college application, so don't feel like you have to pour your soul out in under 100 words. Write a different answer for each of the residential colleges you're applying to. </p></dd>


<a name="14"></a><dt>What comes in my room?</dt>
<dd><p>Each roomate will receive a bed with a mattress that is adjustable in height to about six feet on the frame and the bed comes with a small attachment to hold a book or alarm clock.  You each get a wardrobe that comes with a mirror on the inside, a hanging rod, three drawers of various size, and a large top cabinet.  Along with that you get a medium sized desk, a rolling drawer that fits under (two small and one large compartment), and a nice chair.  Each side of the room comes with 3 power outlets for all your latest gizmos and gadgets, and an ethernet outlet for your computing desires.  To top it off, we provide you with a medium sized tack board to pin all of your achievements and schedules, and a book shelf to store the huge science books that you're bound to get at one point or another.</p>  
<p>
Each room comes with a window-mounted air conditioner, a heater, a trash can to help keep the room clean, and a recycle bin to help save the planet. In addition, each room has a full-room carpet to keep your toes warm and a medium sized overhead light.  </p></dd>

<h5>More FAQ</h5>
<p>Questions with shorter answers will be over here.</p>

<h5>I hear Shepard is weird. Is this true?</h5>
<p>Yes. Come on, you're going to Northwestern! If normal is what you're looking for, you might want to try another university.</p>

<h5>Does Shepard have air conditioning?</h5>
<p>Yes, Shepard does have air conditioning. Each room has its own unit that you control, while common areas like the lounges and hallways are cooled and heated by a building-wide system. </p>

<h5>Where can I store my luggage?</h5>
<p>There is a trunk room in Shepard that you can put your luggage in. The trunk room is open during move-in as well as before and after breaks, and is locked the rest of the year. Some people also find there is plenty of space in their rooms to keep their suitcases.</p>

<h5>How do I do my laundry?</h5>
<p>There are washers and dryers in the basement. Sometimes space becomes a problem, so don't be alarmed or offended if someone removes your laundry after it's done with its cycle. Bring your own detergent and dryer sheets. Both the washers and dryers cost $1 in quarters per load, or you can use money from your Wildcard through your Munch Money account. </p>
