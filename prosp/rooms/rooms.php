<p><b>Sheng:</b>
I didn't expect my room to stay this clean once I got here, but I discovered that I like to keep things organized. Living in a single means less natural light with a smaller window, so I use natural temperature lighting.</p>

comments="<b>Amy and Sherry: </b> If you take advantage of the storage space under your bed, you can have a fair amount of open space in your room, which makes it feel big! We had more than enough space under our beds for suitcases, our refrigerator, and one or two sets of storage drawers. At night, we sometimes end up sitting in a circle on our floor playing games with 5 or 6 friends."

comments="<b>Carrie:</b>  I really like living here. The room is a lot bigger than I thought it would be and I like being able to loft my bed because I can put stuff under there. And the furniture is nice. <br />
<b>Yujin:</b>
I like the room. I think it's a decent size for a double and it's really easy to keep clean. It's cozy and it feels homey but it's not my ideal college room."

comments="<b>Lizzy:</b> I think our room is good. I regret not being more creative with the furniture arrangement.<br />
<b>Dounan:</b> My room is pretty cozy but it can feel cluttered if it gets too messy. I love living in Shepard because it's in a great location - it's close to academic buildings and Allison dining hall is right next doors. CVS and Whole Foods and the rest of downtown Evanston is just a stone's throw away.

comments="<b>Emily:</b> Compared to what I was expecting college dorms, these are pretty nice. The rooms aren't huge, but at the same time I never feel cramped. You can loft the beds to different heights to get more space, and the shelves and bulletin boards are also adjustable. Just by raising my bed a few extra inches, I was able to fit my fridge and my cello case under my bed, which really helped."

comments="<b>Lauryn:</b>  I really like my room. The furniture is pretty nice and it's a decent sized double.  With efficient use of space and some personalizing decor, it has become a nice home for me (that amazingly I keep pretty tidy). <br />"
